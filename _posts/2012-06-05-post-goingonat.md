Together with four other developers, I participated in [Hack the Midwest](http://hackthemidwest.com/), a hackathon held in Kansas City. Our concept was a location based data aggregation service that tried to answer the question "What's going on at...". As a team when ended up winning [Best Use of MapQuest](http://www.kcitp.com/2012/06/07/hackathon-kansas-city-hack-the-midwest-kc/). I created the giraffe and the cityscape as well as code to interface with Instagram. [Fork us on Github](https://github.com/adunkman/goingon.at)!
