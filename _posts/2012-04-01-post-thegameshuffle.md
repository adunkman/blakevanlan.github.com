A entrepreneurial competition called The Next Big Thing is held at Kansas State University every year. This past year a friend and I entered the competition with an idea called The Game Shuffle. The premise of the idea is matching up college kids for buying, selling, and trading used videogames through a well organized site. I created the entire website, including the logo, while my colleague handled the business side of things. Unfortunately, we did not end up winning.
