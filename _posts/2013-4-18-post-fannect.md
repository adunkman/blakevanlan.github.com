For the spring semester of my Sophomore I decided to take an opportunity to become the CTO of a Kansas City startup called Fannect. Fannect is a sports app dedicated to proving which teams have the best fanbases and how you as an individual fan compare to the rest of your team. Originally, I was contracted to build the mobile web version of the iOS app that was being built by a local development shop but I ended up building the entire platform from the ground up. We used Trigger.io to allow us to reuse the HTML5 app I had been building with the main benefit being that we could target Android and iOS with a single code base.
