Along with two internships I have learned a great deal through contract work. A few of the projects can be seen on the [portfolio](/portfolio.html) page.

## Softek Solutions, Inc.

This past summer, 2012, I took an internship with [Softek Solutions, Inc.](http://www.softekinc.com/), a small software company in Prairie Village, Kansas. I spent the summer writing web applications in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and learning to work in a team environment.
