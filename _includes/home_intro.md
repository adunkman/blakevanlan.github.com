## The introduction
I am **Blake VanLandingham** (hopefully that's obvious at this point) and I grew up in Overland Park, KS. I'm just a fun loving guy who truly enjoys quality... *Quality* photography. *Quality* design. *Quality* websites. My focus is on **front end development** and **usability.** I love writing software that helps simplify our complex lives.

## A little background

As a kid in 5th grade I loved to build Starcraft maps and through those many tedious hours I discovered my passion for creation. It wasn't until my sophomore year in high school, when I took my first programming class on VB.Net, that I truly became enthralled in the endless possibilities of software development.
