## A short little bio

My name is **Blake VanLandingham** (hopefully that's obvious) and I'm from Overland Park, KS.
As a kid in 5th grade I loved to build Starcraft maps and through those many tedious hours I
discovered my passion for creation. It wasn't until my sophomore year in high school, when I took
my first programming class on VB.Net, that I became truly enthralled with the endless possibilities
of software development.
